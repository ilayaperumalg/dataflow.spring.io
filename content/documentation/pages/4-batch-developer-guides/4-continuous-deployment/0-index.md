# Continuous Deployment

Spring Cloud Data Flow provides native support for continuous deployment of task applications.

The application registry in Spring Cloud Data Flow lets you register multiple versions for the same task application.

When launching the task applications, you can choose which version of the task application you want to use for the launch. You can also re-use and update the deployment properties used from the previous launch of the same task.

In this section, you will see how you can do continuous deployment of task applications with some examples.
